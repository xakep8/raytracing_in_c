# Raytracing In C
Weekend Dev part 1, wanted to try out some computer graphics in C so ended up writing a raytracing program in C using SDL2 for rendering graphics.

## Building
`git clone`

the project uses CMake so the process is pretty simple

`cmake CMakeLists.txt`

`make`

after this you should see a binary with the name `raytracing` in your current directory

`./raytracing`

this should open up a window by the name `Raytracing`, try clicking inside the window and dragging around, you'll see the lightsouce aka the red circle move. YES IT IS A RED CIRCLE, CLICHE, I KNOW, can't help it
I'm very primitive in terms for graphics.
